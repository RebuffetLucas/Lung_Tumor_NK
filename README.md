## üß¨ Summary

Despite growing interest in NK cell-targeting immunotherapies, the functional states and transcriptional programs of tumor-infiltrating NK cells remain incompletely characterized. Here, we used matched single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing (snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq) to deconvolve the heterogeneity of intratumoral NK cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

We identified two tumor-associated NK (taNK) cell subsets (CD103‚Å∫ and CD49a‚Å∫) with features of circulating NK3 cells, but also signatures of tissue residency, dysfunction, and adaptive reprogramming. Trajectory and regulon analyses showed that inflammatory signals drive their differentiation from early GZMK‚Å∫ NK3 precursors towards a CD39‚Å∫ (ENTPD1‚Å∫) effector phenotype, marked by enhanced interferon signaling and cytotoxic capacity. Functional assays further revealed that CD39‚Å∫ taNK cells retain and even boost cytotoxicity following cytokine stimulation and NKG2A blockade, highlighting them as promising targets for immunotherapy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Most scripts are written in R and Python, with a few notebooks (`.ipynb`) for exploratory and multi-step analyses. See each folder‚Äôs `analysisParams.*` for required packages.

- R ‚â• 4.2
- Python ‚â• 3.8
- Dependencies: Seurat, Signac, SCENIC+, Scanpy, pycistopic, destiny, chromVAR, BayesPrism...

We recommend using `renv` (for R), Docker or Singularity, and `conda` or `virtualenv` (for Python) to isolate environments.

## üìå Key insights

- Discovery of **two major taNK cell states** (CD103‚Å∫ and CD49a‚Å∫) with tissue-residency and adaptive features.
- CD39‚Å∫ NK3 cells emerge as **cytotoxic and targetable effectors** in NSCLC tumors.
- Joint **snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq** resolves NK3 differentiation continuum.
- **Regulon and velocity analyses** reveal drivers of dysfunction and effector adaptation.
- **Therapeutic implications**: cytokine priming and NKG2A blockade may boost NK responses in lung tumors.
